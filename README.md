Whitepaper BioExcel workshop organisation
=========================================

From brainstorming to concrete  
==============================

The Mindset
-----------

*Do*
 - "Fake it till you make it"
 - keep it simple
 - find one person to be your "sanity checker"
 - expect the thing to actually happen
 - get things rolling first, then take people aboard that are interested

*Don't*
 - set up a workshop only because it might look good on your CV
 - set up meetings with potentially interested people too early or with too many participants
 - do anything because that's how one runs a workshop
  - it's not a performance and the interplay between form and content is hardly to be overestimated

Defining a topic
----------------

*Do*
  - put a topic on paper early on
  - take notes when talking to potentially interested people

*Don't*
  - over-define a topic
  - let somebody else use your workshop to float their boat in this stage

Obtaining funding
-----------------

*Do*
  - ask multiple funding sources
    - usually nothing prohibits workshops to be funded from multiple sources
    - often, budgets for scientific exchanges and workshops are underspent
    - your topic will likely fit some larger research environments
  - ask PIs in the relevant field
    - PIs often are too busy to set up and organise workshops themselves but might be very glad to "buy-in"

Defining the format
-------------------

*Do*
  - visiualise from a participants perspective
*Don't*
  - rely much on fancy technology

Finding a place
---------------

*Do*
 - Beware the hidden cost of a place
*Don't*

Picking a date
--------------

*Do*
  -
  - Pick a date early
*Don't*

Before the workshops
====================

Announcing the workshop
-----------------------

Sending out invitations
-----------------------

Setting deadlines
-----------------

Setting expectations
--------------------
*Do*
  - give participants an opportunity to tell you what they expect in advance

*Don't*
  - try to meet all expectations
    - having a few things done well is better than lots of things half-baked
    - participants are surprisingly flexible about the topic if things are just interesting enough and unforgiving if they get bored, not matter the topic

Scheduling a program
--------------------

*Do*
  - ask participants for contributions
    - this gets participants invested in the workshop and makes it "their" workshop
    - getting back to registered participants personally per email is much more effective than a form on a website

*Don't*
  - ignore offered contributions

Accommodation
-------------

*Do*
  - guide participants to very few places
    - increases mingling options
    - people will less likely get lost
    - reimbursements are easier
    - participants are much less likely to "bail out"
    - part of creating a "memorable" workshop experience
  - include a "cheap" option
  - reserve accommodation
      - be very explicit on
        - what you're organising
        - how many people you expect
        - how much deviation you expect
      - it's usually okay to cancel reservations a week in advance, upping the number of rooms however might be difficult
  - inform participants if front desks close at a certain time  

*Don't*
  - go fancy
    - if a workshop goes well, participants will only spend sleeping time in their rooms

Communicating with and between participants
-------------------------------------------

*Do*
 - communicate everything
 - make information permanently and easily accessible
  - email is not permanent
  - check your spam and junk-mail filter
  - send emails one-by-one rather than in a single go
    - avoids you being blacklisted for spamming
    - note that email sending can be scripted
  - allow shared participant communication through a shared channel

*Don't*
 - assume people read emails or websites thoroughly or at all
 - share participant information with other participants without explicit agreement
  - this includes cc'ing all participants in an invitation email

Website and registration form
-----------------------------

*Do*
  - keep it simple and within your skill set
  - use available resources
    - almost all institutions have website managers or a content management system that allows for submission forms
  - use spam protection for your sign-up forms

*Don't*
  - spend money on an external website design
  - micromanage website appearance
  - ask participants for more personal information than absolutely necessary

*Watch out*
 - for data protection regulations when using external services ,e.g., google forms are convenient but are a violation against all data protection regulations

Child care
----------

*Do*
 - organise child care during workshops
 - involve gender equality officers
 - make this visible to the participants
 - make sure to very cleary communicate the extend and nature of the child care offered
    - taking care of a child means that you have to be able to rely on offered services
 - let your funding agency know that you're offering this option
 - try to employ extra funds for this, often gender equality funds are underspent in our area
 - encourage also male participants to bring along their children
 - make sure that the child care provider knows that they might not be needed at all and negotiate payments beforehand  

*Don't*
 - be disappointed if nobody takes your offer; the option alone has worth in itself


The social structure
--------------------

*Do*
 -

*Don't*

Your social responsibility as workshop organiser
------------------------------------------------

*Do*
 - be ready to take the executive decision to remove participants from the workshop if they show problematic behavior, especially towards other participants
  - call out problematic behavior
  - issue clear warnings and be ready to follow through
  - don't intervene alone, but name specific people to aid you if you need to take action
 - check back with workshop participants how they're doing
 - if the workshop is small enough: try to talk to each participant at least once

*Don't*
 - take advantage of your role as organiser
 - exclude / bully workshop participants

Catering options
----------------

During the workshop
===================

Sharing responsibilities
------------------------

*Do*
  - make a back-up plan if you brake a leg
*Don't*
  - take personal

Giving credit where credit is due
---------------------------------

*Do*
 - remember your funding sources
 - remember to include all the "invisibles"
  - make the effort of technical personnel, secretaries,  


After the workshop
==================

Reimbursements
--------------

Asking for feedback
-------------------

*Do*
  - make actual use of the feedback
    - give the participants the feel that their feedback will be implemented
  - beware the type of feedback is drastically dependent on the channel, e.g., person to person, email, forms
  - prepare to take criticism
  - use it to build confidence
*Don't*
  - ask too much, especially in online forms
  - use it for self-confirmation only
